The dock-state details are included as an extra in a sticky broadcast of the ACTION_DOCK_EVENT action. 
Because it's sticky, you don't need to register a BroadcastReceiver. 
You can simply call registerReceiver() passing in null as the broadcast receiver as shown in the next snippet.

IntentFilter ifilter = new IntentFilter(Intent.ACTION_DOCK_EVENT);
Intent dockStatus = context.registerReceiver(null, ifilter);
int dockState = battery.getIntExtra(EXTRA_DOCK_STATE, -1);
boolean isDocked = dockState != Intent.EXTRA_DOCK_STATE_UNDOCKED;

boolean isCar = dockState == EXTRA_DOCK_STATE_CAR;
boolean isDesk = dockState == EXTRA_DOCK_STATE_DESK || 
                 dockState == EXTRA_DOCK_STATE_LE_DESK ||
                 dockState == EXTRA_DOCK_STATE_HE_DESK;


UNDOCKED = 0;
DESK = 1;
CAR = 2;

adb shell am broadcast -a android.intent.action.DOCK_EVENT --ei android.intent.extra.DOCK_STATE 0
adb shell am broadcast -a android.intent.action.DOCK_EVENT --ei android.intent.extra.DOCK_STATE 1
adb shell am broadcast -a android.intent.action.DOCK_EVENT --ei android.intent.extra.DOCK_STATE 2
